**LSalute: Bringing some fun back to events.**\
What this addon does is makes it so when a member of your party is charmed and you have TP you attempt to use a ranged weapon skill on them.
- Commands
  - *//salute \<ws name\>*

**Example: //salute true**
\
\
Addon uses string matching, so you do not have to spell out the entire weapon skill name.
*Currently supports the following weaponskills*
- Leaden Salute
- True Flight
- Namas Arrow
- Apex Arrow
- Empyreal Arrow

\
This is currently in testing due to the nature of how rarely charms may occur so expect bugs, and updates as we test!
